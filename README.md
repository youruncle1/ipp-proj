# IPP Project: Analysis and Interpretation of IPPcode24

**Course:** Principles of Object Oriented Programming Languages (IPP)  
**Languages:** Python, PHP  

## Project Description
This project involved implementing two programs to analyze and interpret the unstructured imperative language IPPcode24. The project was divided into two tasks:

### Part 1: Lexical and Syntactic Analysis (`parse.php`)
- **Description:** Implemented a Python script to analyze IPPcode24 source code and convert it into an XML representation. 
- **Key Features:**
  - Lexical and syntactic error detection.
  - Context-sensitive parsing for valid IPPcode24 constructs.
  - XML output generation with proper encoding.
- **Score:** 7.6/7

### Part 2: Code Interpretation (`interpret.php`)
- **Description:** Developed a PHP script to interpret the XML representation of IPPcode24 and execute the corresponding operations.
- **Key Features:**
  - Object-oriented design with extensibility.
  - Supports memory frames, arithmetic, and control flow operations.
  - Handles input/output and error reporting robustly.
- **Score:** 12/13
